## Abstract

Virtual assistants are more efficient ways to interact with computers. Computers have come a long way from being a device that can only do math. These days, tools are playing a significant and increasing role in our lives, and it can be difficult to catch up with the latest developments and use them effectively. This application is designed to help people interact with computers more naturally and in a more comfortable way. A Virtual Assistant allows a customer to ask for queries in the similar that they would have with a human, and is even capable of doing some basic tasks like opening apps, reading out news, taking notes, Playing video and pausing and playing them etc., with just a voice command. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing in Text to Speech and Speech to Text in Speech Recognition. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing is also used to understand the user’s text and convert it into voice. Artificial Intelligence powered personal assistants can help you to minimize the amount of time that you spend on task and make it more efficient. Minimizes the use of input devices like keyboards, mouses, touch pens, etc. The rapid growth of mobile devices and the introduction of voice-recognition technology has changed how we interact with our devices. It's a mistake to think that a keyboard and mouse are the most efficient ways to interact with a computer. Touch interfaces, voice-recognition, and gestural interfaces have been steadily gaining ground in the market. The new technology that has been introduced by Intel will have a great impact on the world of technology. This new type of chip is more powerful than previous models, but also more efficient. The main idea behind this technology is to use the computer's memory more efficiently, so it won't be necessary to buy expensive hardware or take up much space for it. The Personal Assistants Virtual Assistant is a revolutionary piece of technology, designed to make life easier for all involved. It can be used by everyone from executives, to managers, associates and personal assistants. It's a perfect fit for a variety of work environments and tasks including anything from scheduling meetings and taking notes during those meetings to managing client expectations. We help our clients with day-to-day tasks, freeing up their time for more important things. The Personal Assistant Virtual Assistant is an open source, free software that is available for free download from [GitHub](https://github.com/chirag127/Olivia-A-Personal-Virtual-Assistant). Furthermore, it is also very useful for people who are not able to use the keyboard or mouse. These people include those with cognitive disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities and visual impairment. In order to serve them as well as they can, digital products should be developed to be fully accessible in the future. The Personal Assistant is designed especially for such people who want to interact with their machines and systems using voice.

## Conclusion

In this project we learned how to use the Python programming language to create a personal virtual assistant and how to use the libraries to make it work. The software is very easy to use and very user-friendly to help the user to control the computer by the use of the voice.

## Future work

We can you the contextual voice recognition software to make the software more user-friendly and provide the user with more control over the computer. we can also make the software more intelligent by using the libraries like NLP, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning etc. and provide more personalized assistance to the user.

# problem statement

The problem statement is that we don't have any virtual assistant in windows like google assistant or Siri. So we have to create our own virtual assistant that can help us to control the computer and make it more user-friendly and provide more personalized assistance to the user.

# solution

## algorithm

1. First of all user will open the software by double-clicking on the executable file.
2. Then the user will give the command or query to the software.
3. The software will record the query as a audio file.
4. we will use the speech recognition library to recognize the query.
5. We will then check the query is recognized or not.
6. if the query is not recognized then the software will ask the user to say the query again.
7. then when the query is recognized then the software will check the query using certain keywords.
8. if the query is matched with the keywords then the software will answer the query or do the required action.
