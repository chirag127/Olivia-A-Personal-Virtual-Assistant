## Introduction

Virtual assistants are more efficient ways to interact with computers. Computers have come a long way from being a device that can only do math. These days, tools are playing a significant and increasing role in our lives, and it can be difficult to catch up with the latest developments and use them effectively. This application is designed to help people interact with computers more naturally and in a more comfortable way. A Virtual Assistant allows a customer to ask for queries in the similar that they would have with a human, and is even capable of doing some basic tasks like opening apps, reading out news, taking notes, Playing video and pausing and playing them etc., with just a voice command. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing in Text to Speech and Speech to Text in Speech Recognition. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing is also used to understand the userâ€™s text and convert it into voice. Artificial Intelligence powered personal assistants can help you to minimize the amount of time that you spend on task and make it more efficient. Minimizes the use of input devices like keyboards, mouses, touch pens, etc. The rapid growth of mobile devices and the introduction of voice-recognition technology has changed how we interact with our devices. It's a mistake to think that a keyboard and mouse are the most efficient ways to interact with a computer. Touch interfaces, voice-recognition, and gestural interfaces have been steadily gaining ground in the market. The new technology that has been introduced by Intel will have a great impact on the world of technology. This new type of chip is more powerful than previous models, but also more efficient. The main idea behind this technology is to use the computer's memory more efficiently, so it won't be necessary to buy expensive hardware or take up much space for it. The Personal Assistants Virtual Assistant is a revolutionary piece of technology, designed to make life easier for all involved. It can be used by everyone from executives, to managers, associates and personal assistants. It's a perfect fit for a variety of work environments and tasks including anything from scheduling meetings and taking notes during those meetings to managing client expectations. We help our clients with day-to-day tasks, freeing up their time for more important things. The Personal Assistant Virtual Assistant is an open source, free software that is available for free download from [GitHub](https://github.com/chirag127/Olivia-A-Personal-Virtual-Assistant). Furthermore, it is also very useful for people who are not able to use the keyboard or mouse. These people include those with cognitive disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities and visual impairment. In order to serve them as well as they can, digital products should be developed to be fully accessible in the future. The Personal Assistant is designed especially for such people who want to interact with their machines and systems using voice.

## Aims and objectives

1. The main aim of a voice assistant is to minimize the use of input devices.
2. The Olivia Personal Assistant is a voice assistant that can be used to perform tasks like playing music, playing games, playing videos, taking screenshots, sending emails, sending WhatsApp messages, etc.
3. The Olivia saves the user time and energy by providing a variety of functions.
4. The software is designed to be very useful for people with visual disabilities.
5. The software is designed to be very useful for people with physical disabilities like hand movements, hand-eye coordination, hand loss, etc.
6. The software is designed to be very useful for people with listening disabilities like hearing loss too.
7. The software is designed to be very useful for people with cognitive disabilities like autism, autism spectrum disorder, autism spectrum disorder, etc.
8. The software is designed to be very useful for people with speech disabilities like stuttering, speech impairment, etc.
9. The software is designed to be very useful for people with reading disabilities like dyslexia, etc.
10. The software is designed to be very useful for people with language disabilities like aphasia, bilingualism, etc.

## Methodology

1. First, we will record the voice commands and store them in a database.
2. we will then send the voice command/ query to the server and get the response.
3. The response will contain the text recognised by the server.
4. The response will be match with the keywords in the database.
5. The corresponding response will be sent to the user or the task will be performed.
6. The cycle will repeat until the user quits the application.

## Result expected

The result expected from this project is a personal assistant that can be used by anyone. And it is able to perform most common tasks like playing music, playing games, playing videos, taking screenshots, sending emails, sending WhatsApp messages, etc.
and able to respond to the user's queries in a natural and comfortable way.

## Utilization

The utilization of this project is very simple. The user can use the application by simply speaking the voice commands. The application will then perform the task that the user has asked for. The utilization of this project is very crucial for the disabled people.

## work progress

The future work scope of the project is beyond imagination. The project can incorporate more technologies like deep learning, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. in better ways like contextual voice enabled applications and provide a better user experience. The project can also be used by people who are not able to use the keyboard or mouse in the future. The Olivia can improved to provide more personalized services to the user.
