• Then the user will give the command or query to the software.
• The software will record the query as an audio file.
• We will use the speech recognition library to recognize the query.
• We will then check the query is recognized or not.

---

• If the query is not recognized then the software will ask the user to say the query again.
• Then when the query is recognized then the software will check the query using certain keywords.
